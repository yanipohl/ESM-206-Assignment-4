### Data and Methods

Data for Spiny Lobster abundance and sizes was collected and provided by The Santa Barbara Coastal Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) program. Divers measured abundance and size (mm) in summer before the start of fishing season at five sites along the coast of Santa Barbara. The number and size of spiny lobsters at each site were recorded by in four 300m^2 transects (60 x 5 m) at each site. Data collection begin in the summer of 2012 and was collected annually through 2018. 

### Results

```{r, echo=FALSE}

#read in data, clean names to lowercase snakecase, and uncount the count column

lobster_abundance <- read_csv("lobster_abundance_sbc_lter.csv", na = "-99999") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  uncount(count)

      
```

#### 1. Changes in Lobster Abundance by Site

Spiny lobster abundance shows an overall increase at all sites except Arroyo Quemado during the 2012 to 2018 time period. At the Arroyo Quemado reef site there are minor yearly changes in lobster abundance but the population is relatively stable from 2012 to 2018. There is a sharp increase in abundance beginning in 2016 at Carpenteria and Isla Vista, however in 2017 Carpenteria experienced a significant decline in lobster abundance while Isla Vista lobster abundance continued to increase through 2018.  Isla Vista, Naples, and Mohawk reefs all experienced declines in abundance between 2015 and 2016. At Mohawk reef this decline continued until 2018 while lobster abundance at Isla Vista and Naples reef had recovered by 2017 and 2018, respectively. As for 2017 the only two reef sites where lobster abundance was increasing were Isla Vista and Naples, which are both marine protected areas. All three unprotected reef sites show stable or declining lobster abundance in 2018.

#### 2. Lobster Size Distribution in 2012 and 2018

Isla Vista and Naples, the reef sites within Marine Protected Areas, saw an overall increase in lobster size for the entire population from 2012 to 2018. The number of lobsters above 80 mm (approximate minimum catch size) increased significantly at Isla Vista between 2012 and 2018. At unprotected reef sites the distribution of size in the lobster populations is relatively unchanged in the same time period and the majority of lobsters in these population are smaller than the minimum catch size.

In 2012, lobsters at MPA sites had a mean size of (`r round(mean_mpa_2012, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_mpa_2012, 2)`, n = `r n_mpa_2012`) which differed significantly from mean lobster size in non-MPA sites in 2012 (`r round(mean_nonmpa_2012, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_nonmpa_2012, 2)`, n = `r n_nonmpa_2012`) by a two-sided, two sample t-test (t(`r round(ttest_2012$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(ttest_2012$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(ttest_2012$p.value, 3)`). With a moderate effect size (Cohen's *d* = `r round(d_2012$estimate, 2)`), the difference in mean lobster size in 2012 within MPA sites compared to non-MPA sites is noticeable upon careful review. 

```{r}
# 2. Determine if there is a significant difference in lobster size between MPA and non-MPA sites in 2018.

In 2018 lobsters at MPA sites had a mean size of (`r round(mean_mpa_2018, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_mpa_2018, 2)`, n = `r n_mpa_2018`) which differed significantly from mean lobster size in non-MPA sites in 2018 (`r round(mean_nonmpa_2018, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_nonmpa_2018, 2)`, n = `r n_nonmpa_2018`) by a two-sided, two sample t-test (t(`r round(ttest_2018$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(ttest_2018$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(ttest_2018$p.value, 14)`). With a moderate effect size (Cohen's *d* = `r round(d_2018$estimate, 2)`), the magnitude of the increase in mean lobster size within non-MPA sites compared to MPA sites in 2018 is noticeable.

# Calculate Cohen d to determine effect size

d_mpa  <- cohen.d(lobster_2012_mpa, lobster_2018_mpa)


```
In 2012 lobsters at MPA sites had a mean size of (`r round(mean_mpa_2012, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_mpa_2012, 2)`, n = `r n_mpa_2012`) which differed significantly from mean lobster size in MPA sites in 2018 (`r round(mean_mpa_2018, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_mpa_2018, 2)`, n = `r n_mpa_2018`) by a two-sided, two sample t-test (t(`r round(ttest_mpa$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(ttest_mpa$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(ttest_mpa$p.value, 14)`). With a large effect size (Cohen's *d* = `r round(d_mpa$estimate, 2)`), the differnce in mean lobster size between MPA sites in 2012 compared to MPA sites in 2018 is noticeable.

```{r}
# 4. Determine if there is a significant difference in lobsters observed in 2012 vs. 2018 for non-MPA sites.

# Run 2 sides T Test using pulled values for 2012 non mpa sites and 2018 non mpa sites

# Calculate Cohen d to determine effect size

d_nonmpa  <- cohen.d(lobster_2012_nonmpa, lobster_2018_nonmpa)
```
In 2012 lobsters at non MPA sites had a mean size of (`r round(mean_nonmpa_2012, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_nonmpa_2012, 2)`, n = `r n_nonmpa_2012`) which did not differ significantly from mean lobster size in non-MPA sites in 2018 (`r round(mean_nonmpa_2018, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_nonmpa_2018, 2)`, n = `r n_nonmpa_2018`) by a two-sided, two sample t-test (t(`r round(ttest_nonmpa$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(ttest_nonmpa$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(ttest_nonmpa$p.value, 3)`). With a small effect size (Cohen's *d* = `r round(d_nonmpa$estimate, 2)`), the difference in mean lobster size within non-MPA sites in 2012 compared to non-MPA sites in 2018 is not noticible.
